Hello! I'm Kathleen Hablutzel and I'm a double major in Computer Science & Statistical and Data Sciences at Smith College ('23). I especially enjoy data visualization, data communication, and networks. I'm a software engineering intern in Smith's Grubb Lab, where I contribute to [BloomingLeaf](https://github.com/amgrubb/BloomingLeaf), a web-based tool for goal-oriented requirements engineering, and I'm also the TA for Smith's first-ever applied algorithms course. In the past, I've volunteered as a data scientist for a Congressional campaign (Cynthia Wallace in 2020) and built an [introductory data science course](srip-bootcamp/) for high school students. This upcoming Summer 2021, I will be an intern in Bank of America's Global Technology Sophomore Summer Analyst Program, and I can't wait to get started!

When I'm not coding or nerding out over cool graphs, I enjoy building props and sets with the Smith College Theater Department, coding cryptographic ciphers, and exploring 16^th^ century British politics.
