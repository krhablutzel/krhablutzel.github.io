Hello! I'm Kathleen Hablutzel and I'm a double major in Computer Science & Statistical and Data Sciences (SDS) at Smith College ('23). I especially enjoy data visualization, data communication, and databases, and I love sharing data science enough that I built a [5-lesson introductory Data Science Bootcamp](krhablutzel.github.io/srip-bootcamp/) for high school students. 

Currently, I volunteer as a Bluebonnet Data Fellow producing tactical field analyses for Cynthia Wallace’s Congressional campaign in North Carolina’s 9th district. I was drawn to Wallace’s campaign for the opportunity to apply data science to empower an underestimated campaign and flip a crucial Congressional district. I also research the history and politics of data analytics through Smith’s STRIDE Research Program, in conjunction with the Zollman Scholarship, Smith's highest merit scholarship. I am most proficient in R, Python, and Java, and have experience including SQL, HTML5, and supercomputing.

When I'm not coding or nerding out over cool graphs, I enjoy building props and sets with the Smith College Theater Department and exploring 16^th^ century British politics.
